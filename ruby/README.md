# Ruby and Identibyte example

This directory contains an example of how to integrate Identibyte with
your Ruby application. The sample code here uses basic, standard
libraries to check if a given email address is disposable.

**Here's the series of events**
- Get the email address to check
- Build the API request using Ruby's `net/http` library
- Make request to Identibyte to see if the email is a DEA
- Print the result.
