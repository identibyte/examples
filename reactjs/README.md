# React.js and Identibyte example

This directory contains an example of how to integrate Identibyte with
your React.js application. The sample code here hooks in to a Signup
Form component and checks if the email address is disposable before
submitting the form.

**Here's the series of events**
- User fills out and submits form
- The default form submission is prevented
- Check if the email is a DEA on Identibyte
- If so, show an error
- If not, submit the form
