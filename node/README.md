# Node.js and Identibyte example

This directory contains an example of how to integrate Identibyte with
your Node.js application. The sample code here uses the standard
`https` library to make a request to the API and check if a given
email address is disposable.

**Here's the series of events**
- Get the email address to check
- Build the API request using Node.js's `https` library
- Make request to Identibyte to see if the email is a DEA
- Print the result.
